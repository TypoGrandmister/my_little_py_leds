# my_little_py_leds
my little project for controlling leds

the code is split into 2
python FFT for note detection and updating the ESP for new notes/change in volume of tone/note stoped playing
CPP in ESP32 is in charge of the effects
to do:
  add multipule ESPs suppert (more leds require more ESPs)
  check how stable PWM is
  add loop back without VB cable 
  add schamitcs for leds
